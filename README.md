Somewhere between then and now you discovered this cairne in the fog. I hope it is useful in some way. Inspiration, reference, or whatever you're looking for.

This is written perhaps as more of a reminder for myself than it is for you, but then again you could be future me or maybe past me stuck in a strange loop...

```bash
$ whoami
error: entity unknown or undefined
```

Steady...

The way out, is through.

## Feature Highlights

- Flake-based multi-host, multi-user configurations for NixOS, Darwin, and Home-Manager

  - Core configs for hosts and users dynamically handle nixos- or darwin-based host specifications
  - Optional configs for user and host-specific needs
  - Facilitation for custom modules, overlays, packages, and library

- Secrets management via sops-nix and a _private_ nix-secrets repo which is included as a flake input
- Declarative, LUKS-encrypted btrfs partitions via disko
- Automated remote-bootstrapping of NixOS, nix-config, and _private_ nix-secrets
- Handles multiple YubiKey devices and agent forwarding for touch-based/passwordless authentication during:

    - login
    - sudo
    - ssh
    - git commit signing
    - LUKS2 decryption

- Automated borg backups
- NixOS and Home-Manager automation recipes

The roadmap of additional features is laid across functionally thematic stages that can be viewed, along with short term objectives, in the [Roadmap of TODOs](docs/TODO.md).

Completed features will be added here as each stage is complete.

## Requirements

- When using NixOS, v23.11 or later is required to properly receive passphrase prompts when building in the private nix-secrets repo
- Patience
- Attention to detail
- Persistence
- More disk space

This is a personalized configuration that has several technical requirements to build successfully. This nix-config will serve you best as a reference, learning resource, and template for crafting your own configuration. I am continuing to provide resources throughout this repository, my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Emergent_Mind), and [website](https://unmovedcentre.com) to help. For you to be successful, you must also experiment and learn as you go to create a nix environment that suits your needs.

## Structure Quick Reference

For details about design concepts, constraints, and how structural elements interact, see the article and/or Youtube video [Anatomy of a NixOS Config](https://unmovedcentre.com/posts/anatomy-of-a-nixos-config/) available on my website.

For a large screenshot of the concept diagram, as well as previous iterations, see [Anatomy](docs/anatomy.md).

</div>

- `flake.nix` - Entrypoint for hosts and user home configurations. Also exposes a devshell for  manual bootstrapping tasks (`nix develop` or `nix-shell`).
- `hosts` - NixOS configurations accessible via `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<host>`.
  - `common` - Shared configurations consumed by the machine specific ones.
    - `core` - Configurations present across all hosts. This is a hard rule! If something isn't core, it is optional.
    - `disks` - Declarative disk partition and format specifications via disko.
    - `optional` - Optional configurations present across more than one host.
    - `users` - Host level user configurations present across at least one host.
        - `<user>/keys` - Public keys for the user that are symlinked to ~/.ssh
  - `dariwn` - machine specific configurations for hosts on dariwn systems
      - Currently not using any darwin hosts
  - `linux` - machine specific configurations for hosts on linux systems
      - `genoa` - stage 6
      - `ghost` - Primary box - 4.0GHz Ryzen 5 3600XT (6C/12T), 64MB RAM, Radeon RX5600XT
      - `grief` - Lab - Qemu VM
      - `gooey` - stage x
      - `guppy` - Remote Install Lab - Qemu VM
      - `gusto` - Theatre - Asus VivoPC - 1.5GHz Celeron 1007U, 4GB RAM, onboard Intel graphics
      - `iso` - custom NixOS ISO that incorporates some quality of life configuration for use during installations and recovery
- `home/<user>` - Home-manager configurations, built automatically during host rebuilds.
  - `common` - shared home-manager configurations consumed the user's machine specific ones.
    - `core` - Home-manager configurations present for user across all machines. This is a hard rule! If something isn't core, it is optional.
    - `optional` - Optional home-manager configurations that can be added for specific machines. These can be added by category (e.g. options/media) or individually (e.g. options/media/vlc.nix) as needed.
      The home-manager core and options are defined in host-specific .nix files housed in `home/<user>`.
- `lib` - Custom library used throughout the nix-config to make import paths more readable. Accessible via `lib.custom`.
- `modules` - Custom modules to enable special functionality and options.
    - `common` - Custom modules that will work on either linux or dariwn but that aren't specific to home-manager
    - `darwin` - Custom modules specific to dariwn-based hosts
    - `home-manager` - Custom modules to home-manager
    - `nixos` - Custom modules specific to linux-based hosts
- `nixos-installer` - A stripped down version of the main nix-config flake used exclusively during installation of NixOS and nix-config on hosts.
- `overlays` - Custom modifications to upstream packages.
- `pkgs` - Custom packages meant to be shared or upstreamed.
    - `common` - Custom packages that will work on either linux or dariwn
    - `darwin` - Custom packages specific to dariwn-based hosts
    - `nixos` - Custom packages specific to linux-based hosts
- `scripts` - Custom scripts for automation, including remote installation and bootstrapping of NixOS and nix-config.

## Secrets Management

Secrets for this config are stored in a private repository called nix-secrets that is pulled in as a flake input and managed using the sops-nix tool.

For details on how this is accomplished, how to approach different scenarios, and troubleshooting for some common hurdles, please see my article and accompanying YouTube video [NixOS Secrets Management](https://unmovedcentre.com/posts/secrets-management/) available on my website.
